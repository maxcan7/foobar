# Foobar


## Purpose
This was a take-home coding challenge I did for a company a long time ago. See instructions for the nature of the task.

I've removed all references to the original company (hence Foobar), and it was long enough ago that I hope they've since changed their coding challenge. If not I apologize! But I was really happy with this codebase, I still use it as a template for personal projects sometimes, so I wanted to finally upload it to github.

In the time since then I've definitely become a stronger programmer, but for now I've left it as-is, including the parts where I say X or Y could have been designed better or was incomplete.

## Getting Started
This package contains a codebase for Foobar's take-home coding challenge. It is written in python 3.8. It is recommended you use a conda or virtual environment. It comes with a python package installer via setup.py as well as a Click-based command-line interface.

### Install
Installing the package will automatically install all requirements from requirements.txt  
CD into the package directory  
`$ pip install -e .`  

### Use
`$ foobar --help`
